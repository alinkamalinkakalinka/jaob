/**
 * Provides the Marshaller with the Information how to build
 * the individual URI.
 * </br>
 * Before creating the Individual the Marshaller will look for this
 * Annotation on a Field or Method. The Method may not have any Arguments 
 * and has to return a value (String is usually the best choice).
 * <br>
 * Consider the following Examples:
 * <h5>Example 1</h5>
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @}OwlClass(uri="some:uri#MyClass")
 * public class MyClass{
 * 		
 *	{@literal @}OwlIndividualId
 *	private String id;
 * 	
 *	// other stuff
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Here the marshaller will read the value from the field {@code id} and will
 * build an individual URI like {@code ontologyUri + "#" + id}.
 * 
 * <h5>Example 2</h5>
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @}OwlClass(uri="some:uri#MyClass")
 * public class MyClass{
 * 
 *	{@literal @}OwlIndividualId
 *	private Object getInfo(){
 * 	
 *	}		
 *	// other stuff
 *}
 * </pre>
 * Here the marshaller will call the Method {@code getInfo()} and will create an 
 * Individual with the URI {@code ontologyUri + "#" + getInfo().toString()}.
 *
